# Task 1: Data Handling with NumPy & Pandas

## Objective

To develop a strong foundation in **data loading, cleaning, and manipulation** using **Pandas** and **NumPy** on a real-world student performance dataset.

## Approach

* Loaded the dataset using Pandas and explored its structure using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`.
* Checked data quality by verifying **missing values** and **duplicate records**.
* Converted numerical features into NumPy arrays for efficient computation.
* Calculated **mean, median, and standard deviation** using NumPy.
* Applied vectorized operations such as **z-score normalization**.

## Results & Insights

* Dataset contains **10,000 records and 15 features** with no missing or duplicate values.
* Academic and behavioral features show well-distributed statistics.
* NumPy operations enabled fast numerical transformations.
* Normalized data is suitable for further analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Conclusion

This task demonstrates effective use of **Pandas for data handling** and **NumPy for numerical analysis**, preparing the dataset for advanced modeling tasks.
